# MechaCarChallenge
## Overview
- To assist Jeremy with analyzing statistics using R programming language and Rstudio to populate data based on given dataset. 

  1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the  mpg of MechaCar prototypes.<br>
  2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.<br>
  3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.<br>
  4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

 * In the above statistics, we can observe that only **Vehicle_Length** and **Ground_Clearance** provides a non-random amount of variance to the mpg claues in the dataset. 
 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
